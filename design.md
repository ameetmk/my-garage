# How to Design not just software
The knowledge and carbon dioxide are not good inside human body.


# Rule No. 1 : Break it like Ralph
Yes, first get the whole and break it at its core.
Anything that is built is never built at once, but with small parts making their ways to the whole after several iterations

Example: A house is not just built with bricks and cement, but also with steel and concrete. But. this whole way to build wasn't discovered at once.
First with just wood logs, then with mud pasted on it, then with mud bricks with mud in betweek... then with little cement, then RCC then etc., etc., and now latest model..!

Hence, to arrive at a conclusion of building houses like what we have today, took several decades, sometimes on just bricks...!

So, never be worried on whole end solutions, you may face iterations in small component itself.

As long as you're aware of end solution, you'll never get diverted, but rather you'll be focussed, no matter how small work you're doing in the whole process of building it.

# Rule No. 2 : Divide and conquer
Now we have broken and identified small things, the power lies in how you process it. The buzzword MPP (Massively Parallel Prcessing) isn't new... its been followed from long, long time ago. All the wars, medical outbreaks, earth quakes etc., were handled and recovered out of them was through MPP's.

Once you're clear with bricks and cements of your architecture, identify those who can do best for each of these. Remember a brick maker will never produce great mixture of cement and concrete.

Divde tasks to those who can do best, not better nor good and don't follow up, you know it already they can do best.

# Rule No. 3 : Status, the worst thing to be asked
Never ask status on task, but ask if they need any help. The answer will always be status, and most of the times they won't need help but just moral support.

# Rule No. 4 : Conclude, again the worst thing
As a leader, you should listen to your intuit and act accordingly. If you think enough, lets stop this thing or yes this works but needs some improvement, stop it. give it a break... sometimes a break gives returns more than continuos stress.

# Rule No. 5 : Iterate, re-iterate
Nothing can be achieved in first hand... thats why world still has so many second hand stuff ! lets give it to second hands, let them check, test, break and suggest... improve and re-improve... deploy and celebrate.
